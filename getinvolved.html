      <strong>MEAT</strong>
      <br><br>
      When purchased responsibly, meat and poultry can be a sustainable source of protein. The benefits go beyond just a smaller environmental footprint-  sustainably raised meat is typically more lean and nutrient rich, and safer because it is not raised with antibiotics. Look for these labels
        <ul>
          <li><b>USDA Organic -</b> These meats are produced using organic vegetarian feed (no synthetic pesticides, chemicals, or GMOs) and no antibiotics or hormones. </li>
          <li><b>Grass Fed -</b> These animals are fed a grass diet rather than corn or soy, making it easier to digest. They are also not given antibiotics or hormones. </li>
          <li><b>Pasture Raised -</b> These animals are raised on pastures where they are free to roam and feed, rather than being confined indoors or packed in feedlots. </li>
        </ul>

      <strong>SEAFOOD</strong>
      <br><br>
      Depending on the type of fish, eating seafood has the potential to be both sustainable and environmentally destructive. The Monterey Bay Aquarium ranks fish as Best Option, Good Alternative, and Avoid, based on whether the fish are harvested in ways that protect other marine life and the environment.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Best Option:</b> Alaskan Cod, US Catfish, New Zealand Salmon, US farmed shrimp, Albacore and Skipjack Tuna (trolls or pole and line caught)</li>
        <li><b>Good Alternative:</b> Pacific Cod, Dungeness Crab, US Mahi Mahi, Monkfish, US Tilapia, Skipjack and Yellowfin Tuna (imported, longline)</li>
        <li><b>Avoid:</b> Atlantic Cod, Atlantic Salmon, Sardines, Bluefin and Yellowfin Tuna</li>
      </ul>
          Since the list changes from year to year, be sure to check the <a href="http://www.seafoodwatch.org/">Seafood Watch</a> website to stay up to date.

    <strong>LOCAL</strong>
    <br><br>
    Buying food grown or produced locally reduces the amount of fossil fuels needed for transportation. Locally grown produce is also typically fresher, whereas imported produce is often frozen or preserved in order to maintain color and freshness. For the greatest variety of local produce, try shopping at a Farmers Market. Or, look for products labeled “locally grown” at the grocery store
    <ul>
      <li>To find a nearby farmer’s market, visit <a href="https://www.localharvest.org/farmers-markets">here</a> </li>
    </ul>

      <strong>ORGANIC</strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      With so many products claiming to be organic, what exactly does this label mean? In order to be officially labeled USDA organic, a product must meet a certain set of standards.
      <ul>
        <li>Grown without the use of synthetic pesticides or chemicals</li>
        <li> Produced without genetic engineering</li>
      </ul>
      Why does this matter? Synthetic pesticides contain nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus that leach into the groundwater, and eventually reach bodies of water. These nutrients cause rapid bacterial growth, creating deoxygenated “dead zones” as the bacteria decomposes. Without enough oxygen, fish and marine life begin to die off. When crops are genetically engineered to resist pests, the pests are forced to adapt and develop resistance to the pesticides. This means that more pesticides are required, creating an endless cycle of pest adaption and pesticide increase.
      <br><br>
      Be sure to look for the official “USDA Organic” seal on products, as well as the label “100% Organic” to ensure that the food was truly produced in a sustainable way.

      <strong>SEASONAL</strong>
      <br><br>
      Seasonal produce is more likely to be grown locally, meaning that less greenhouse gases are emitted in order to transport the product. Grocery stores appear to have nearly every variety of fruit and vegetable at all times, when in reality out of season produce has to be shipped from thousands of miles away.
      <br>
      Becoming aware of what fruits and vegetables are in season allows for a more mindful grocery shopping experience.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Spring:</b> Broccoli, Mushrooms, Cauliflower, Carrots</li>
        <li><b>Summer:</b> Berries, Watermelon, Zucchini, Cucumbers, Tomatoes</li>
        <li><b>Fall:</b> Apples, Sweet Potatoes, Pumpkin, Peas</li>
        <li><b>Winter:</b> Squash, Potatoes, Avocados, Apples, Grapefruit</li>
      </ul>
