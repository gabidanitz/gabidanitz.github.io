      <strong>Meat</strong>
      When purchased responsibly, meat and poultry can be a sustainable source of protein. The benefits go beyond just a smaller environmental footprint-  sustainably raised meat is typically more lean and nutrient rich, and safer because it is not raised with antibiotics. Look for these labels
        <ul>
          <li>USDA Organic - These meats are produced using organic vegetarian feed (no synthetic pesticides, chemicals, or GMOs) and no antibiotics or hormones. </li>
          <li>Grass Fed - These animals are fed a grass diet rather than corn or soy, making it easier to digest. They are also not given antibiotics or hormones. </li>
          <li>Pasture Raised - These animals are raised on pastures where they are free to roam and feed, rather than being confined indoors or packed in feedlots. </li>
