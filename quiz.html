Nearly 20% of greenhouse gas emissions, including 40% of methane emissions, come from livestock production. Additionally, over two thirds of crops grown across the globe are put towards animal feed. It also contributes to soil erosion, freshwater depletion, and nutrient pollution from fertilizers used to grow livestock feed. While you donâ€™t have to go vegetarian, reducing your meat consumption by even a few times a week can reduce your environmental footprint. Try giving up meat one day a week, and aim to implement more pasture raised poultry and less red meats into your diet.";
