While you don’t have to go vegetarian, try giving up meat one day a week, and replacing some of the red meat in your diet with poultry. Poultry only accounts for 10% of greenhouse gas emissions caused by meat production, and requires 5 times less feed than livestock.";

This creates methane, a greenhouse gas that is a powerful contributor to global warming. By reducing your meat consumption to once a day, you are off to a great start. Try to incorporate a few more meatless dinners each week to further reduce your environmental footprint.";

These zones have little to no oxygen, causing fish and marine life to suffocate. By eating meat less frequently, you are already significantly reducing your environmental footprint. To take it a step further, try focusing on purchasing high quality, sustainably raised meat rather than meat produced on factory farms. Look for the labels “USDA Organic”, “pasture raised” and “grass-fed” when shopping for meat.";

To further reduce your impact, aim to buy locally sourced groceries and produce. Local foods require less energy to transport, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.";
